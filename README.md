## 4. Dataset Overview
The dataset is the online_retail_II dataset sourced from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci).
And covers the years 2009 - 2011.

### 5. Dataset Shape
**Rows**: 1067371.
**Columns**: 8.

### 6. Key Variables
The 8 Columns are: Invoice, StockCode, Quantity, Description, InvoiceDate, Price, Customer ID, Country.

### 7. Data Types
- object
- int64
- float64

## 8. Project Scope & Tools

### 9. Scope
**In Scope**: All 8 columns can be used for the analysis.

**Out of Scope**: During the EDA, I will exclude all stock codes beginning with 'C' as these are cancelled orders/transactions
and could skew the results. I will use the cancelled orders for the dashboard.

### 10. Tools & Technology
- Jupyter Notebook - This will be used for the Analysis part of the project.
- CSV file - The dataset is in a CSV format.
- Power BI - Will be used to create the dashboard in the final step.
- Power BI Service - To share the dashboard.

## 11. Missing Data
**Null values**:
Description - 4382 (22.77%)
Customer ID - 243007 (0.41%)

**Negative Values**:
Customer ID - this shows that orders were from guest orders or that the order was cancelled.
Quantity - There are negative values in the Quantity column, which match the Cancelled orders/transactions.

## 12. Data Cleaning
**Null Values**
- Customer ID - Changed all 0 values and null values to 0 to represent Guest checkouts.

**Empty Values**
- Quantity - All 0 values in Quantity related to Cancelled orders/transactions, these were removed as they would skew the results.
- Price - All 0 values in Price related to Cancelled orders/transactions, these were removed so they did not skew the results.

**Data Type Changes**
- InvoiceDate - Changed the InvoiceDate from an object to datetime.
- Customer ID - Changed from float to int.
- Customer ID - Changed from float64 to int64.

**New Columns Added**
- Weekday - Added a weekday column to make trend analysis easier.
- TotalSales - Makes the transactions easier to analyse in full cost.
